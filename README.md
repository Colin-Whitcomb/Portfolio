## Summary & Processs

In this assignment our objective was to update our portfolio pages. I maintained a similar framework from before; however, I made some changes.

I added a landing page (shown above) that is clean and clear. My next two pages contain a portfolio and an "About Me" section. I added images of my deployed applications and accompanied them with links to their respective URL and GitHub repositories.

In an attempt to differentiate from every ... bootstrap website ever, I went ahead and used <a href="https://materializecss.com/">Materialize</a>
as a CSS Framework. For extra individualisation, I constructed a first draft logo and made sure to create a cohesive color scheme throughout.
